						<h2>Judson Baptist Church 85th Anniversary</h2>
							<span class="smalltitles">Mission & Vision</span>
					<p>Commemorating this well-established church's 85th anniversary was a formidable challenge. The leadership desired to acknowledge its rich history while at the same time look forward with anticipation to its future. Vicki initiated, with a team of church leaders, the "Rooted. Ready. Reaching." theme which involved a print campaign, internal special events and community-based activities.</p>

						<h2>Fred Crump children’s books</h2>
							<span class="smalltitles">Marketing</span>
								<p>The marketing plan developed for these unique, African American children's books had to engage three primary audiences:  consumers, bookstores and churches.  It did so successfully by using traditional tactics such as a PR campaign (garnering more than a dozen book reviews), print promotions, online reviews and field & call center sales reps.  In addition, a children's coloring contest was a creative and fun grassroots way to gain awareness.</p>

					<h2>Teaching for Spiritual Growth series</h2>
						<span class="smalltitles">Marketing</span>
							<p>After first managing the development of this series, Vicki also initiated its launch and led the marketing effort.  Dialogue with the authors and feedback from teachers made it clear that a direct-to-institutions & educators approach was necessary.  Therefore, we developed a workshop series that used content from the books as a foundation to train leaders on how to effectively organize multi-generational education specifically in the Black Church.</p>

					<h2>Entrenuity</h2>
						<span class="smalltitles">Branding</span>
							<p>Serving under-resourced communities through entrepreneurship education since 1999, Entrenuity's identity required updating. Vicki composed the organization's tag line and contributed to the update of its mission statement, logo and overall identity.</p>
